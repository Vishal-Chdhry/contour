## Enable configuring Server header transformation 

Envoy's treatment of the Server header on responses can now be configured in the Contour config file or ContourConfiguration CRD.
When configured as `overwrite`, Envoy overwrites any Server header with "envoy".
When configured as `append_if_absent`, ‚Å£if a Server header is present, Envoy will pass it through, otherwise, it will set it to "envoy".
When configured as `pass_through`, Envoy passes through the value of the Server header and does not append a header if none is present.
